This is an application to see movie details for around 7k movies. This uses movies API created by me https://softgenie.org/api/movies

For a change I tried using complete vanilla CSS for this project.

## Screenshots

Would be added later as it is likely to change if I decide to change the theme.

## Features

- Can search for movies in a database spanning across 7k movies mostly from India
- Includes a detail movie page.
- Include react redux and redux-toolkit for state data management.

## State Management using React redux and redux-toolkit

Redux Toolkit is the official, recommended way to write Redux logic. It provides a set of tools and best practices that simplify the process of writing Redux code, making it easier to manage and scale your application's state. With Redux Toolkit, you can efficiently handle complex state logic, reduce boilerplate code, and improve maintainability.

Key features of Redux Toolkit include:

- Simplified configuration with `configureStore()`
- Built-in support for immutable updates with `createSlice()`
- Powerful data fetching and caching with `createAsyncThunk()`
- Enhanced developer experience with built-in middleware and DevTools integration
